# Card-Client

Really early build of a client to play our custom TCG. Just ask me if you have any questions.

To run this right now, you'll need Love2d: https://love2d.org/. Zip up the entire folder and rename the extension to .love. Then, drag this file onto Love.exe to run it. Use A to spawn cards for now.
